In this folder I have a python notebook with which I can manage my catalogs format via pandas. I can switch from matchlocate format, to zmap, to any other format i may need to better display my results. Up until now, I have created only a script that helps me modify a zmap formatted catalog in order to display all seismic events ordered by the time of occurence. Will add more useful notebooks if needed.
