Here I present a jupyter notebook that allows me to create a histogram plot from '.txt' data files containing two parameters: binedges and barheight

With this script we can create a histogram showing the amount of seismic detections vs time, date, magnitude, longitude, latitude, depth of the event

This script also allows you to plot the background seismic level for the parameter entered as a comparison and guide to find anomalous values or patterns.
