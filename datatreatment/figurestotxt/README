Here I leave a matlab script that alllows me to extract histogram data from a matlab figure (in this case itÂ´s a figure taken from zmap) 
This script takes two parameters from the histogram figure as:

'binedges' : limits to each bar plot to represent the histogram on the x axis
'barheight' : height to each bar plot to represent the histogram on the y axis 

This script needs two parameters to be changed such as the name of the '.fig' file, on line 1, and name of the output '.txt' file, on line 11

This script returns a '.txt' file that can be used to create a histogram through a jupyter notebook that can be foun in /allmyresults/graphs/amountofevents/plottimevsamountofdetections.ipynb
